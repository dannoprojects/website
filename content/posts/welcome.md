‘Hello World!’ 

Now that I’ve gotten that taken care of, onward to other things.

I’m a Systems Admin working at OmnicomMediaGroup.  Lately I’ve been working on a PowerShell module for API calls into our in house developed onboarding platform. 

In my spare time, I’ve been working on a few Raspberry Pi projects to automate video uploads and transcoding into AWS buckets.  

As I run across things that interest me, I’ll post about them.
